\section{Products in cohomology}

We'll talk about the cohomology cross product first. Actually, the first
step is to produce a map on chains that goes in the reverse direction from
the cross product we constructed in Lecture 7. 

\begin{construction}
For each pair of natural numbers $p,q$, we will define a natural homomorphism 
\[
\alpha: S_{p+q}(X\times Y)\to S_p(X)\otimes S_q(Y)\,.
\]
It suffices to define this on simplices, so let 
$\sigma:\Delta^{p+q}\to X\times Y$ be a singular $(p+q)$-simplex in the product. Let $\sigma_1=\pr_1\circ\sigma:\Delta^{p+q}\to X$$ and 
$\sigma_2=\pr_2\circ\sigma:\Delta^{p+q}\to Y$$ 
be the two cooridinates of $\sigma$. I have to produce
a $p$-simplex in $X$ and a $q$-simplex in $Y$.
 
First define two maps in the simplex category: 

\smallskip
the ``front face''  $\alpha_p:[p]\to[p+q]$, sending $i$ to $i$ for $0\leq i\leq p$, 

\smallskip
and the ``back face'' $\omega_q:[q]\to[p+q]$, sending $j$ to $j+p$ for $0\leq j\leq q$. 

\smallskip\noindent
Use the same symbols for the affine 
extensions to maps $\Delta^p\to \Delta^{p+q}$ and $\Delta^q\to\Delta^{p+q}$. 
Now let 
\[
\alpha(\sigma)=(\sigma_1\circ\alpha_p)\otimes(\sigma_2\circ\omega_q)\,.
\]
\end{construction}
This seems like a very random construction; but it works! It's named after two
great early algebraic topologists, James W. Alexander and Hassler Whitney.
For homework, you will show that these maps assemble into a chain map
\[
\alpha:S_\ast(X\times Y)\to S_\ast(X)\otimes S_\ast(Y)\,.
\]

This works over any ring $R$. To get a map in cohomology, we should form
a composite 
\[
S^p(X;R)\otimes_RS^q(Y;R)\to
\Hom_R(S_p(X;R)\otimes_RS_q(Y;R),R)\xrightarrow{\alpha^*}
\Hom_R(S_{p+q}(X\times Y;R),R)=S^{p+q}(X\times Y;R)\,.
\]
The first map goes like this: Given chain complexes $C_\ast$ and $D_\ast$, 
we can consider the dual cochain complexes $\Hom_R(C_\ast,R)$ and
$\Hom_R(D_\ast,R)$, and construct a chain map 
\[
\Hom_R(C_\ast,R)\otimes_R\Hom_R(D_\ast,R)\to\Hom_R(C_\ast\otimes_R D_\ast,R)
\]
by 
\begin{equation*}
f\otimes g\mapsto\begin{cases}
(x\otimes y\mapsto (-1)^{pq}f(x)g(y)) & |x|=|f|=p, |y|=|g|=q\\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
Again, I leave it to you to check that this is a chain map. 

Altogether, we have constructed a natural chain map
\[
\times:S^p(X)\otimes S^q(Y)\to S^{p+q}(X\times Y)
\]
From this, we get a homomorphism
\[
H^\ast(S^\ast(X)\otimes S^\ast(Y))\to H^\ast(X\times Y)\,.
\]
I'm not quite done! As in the K\"unneth theorem, there is an evident natural 
map 
\[
 H^\ast(X)\otimes H^\ast(Y)\to H^\ast(S^\ast(X)\otimes S^\ast(Y))\,.
\] 
The composite
\[
\times:H^\ast(X)\otimes H^\ast(Y)\to H^\ast(S^\ast(X)\otimes S^\ast(Y))\to H^\ast(X\times Y)
\]
 is the {\em cohomology cross product}.

It's not very easy to do computations with this, directly. We'll find indirect means. Let me make some points about this construction, though.
\begin{definition}
The {\em cup product} is the map obtained by taking $X=Y$ and composing with
the map induced by the diagonal $\Delta:X\to X\times X$:
\[
\cup:H^p(X)\otimes H^q(X)\xrightarrow{\times} H^{p+q}(X\times X)\xrightarrow{\Delta^\ast} H^{p+q}(X),.
\]
\end{definition}
These definitions make good sense with any ring for coefficients.

Let's explore this definition in dimension zero. 
I claim that $ H^0(X;R)\cong\Map(\pi_0(X),R)$ as rings. When $p=q=0$, both $\alpha_0$ and $\omega_0$ are the identity maps, so we are just forming the 
pointwise product of functions. 

There's a distinguished element in $H^0(X)$, namely the the function $\pi_0(X)\to R$ that takes on the value 1 on every path component. 
This is the identity for the cup product. This comes out because when $p=0$ in our above story, then $\alpha_0$ is just including the $0$-simplex, and $\omega_q$ is the identity. 

The cross product is also associative, even on the chain level. 
\begin{prop}
Let $f\in S^p(X)$, $g\in S^q(Y)$, and $h\in S^r(Z)$, and let 
$\sigma:\Delta^{p+q+r}\to X\times Y\times Z$ be any simplex. Then
\[
((f\times g)\times h)(\sigma)=(f\times(g\times h))(\sigma)\,.
\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Write $\sigma_{12}$ for the composite of $\sigma$ with the projection map
$X\times Y\times Z\to X\times Y$, and so on. Then
\[
((f\times g)\times h)(\sigma)=(-1)^{(p+q)r}
(f\times g)(\sigma_{12}\circ\alpha_{p+q})h(\sigma_3\circ\omega_r)\,.
\]
But 
\[(f\times g)(\sigma_{12}\circ\alpha_{p+q})=(-1)^{pq}
f(\sigma_1\circ\alpha_p)g(\sigma_2\circ\mu_q)\,,
\] 
where $\mu_q$ is the ``middle face,'' sending $\ell$ to $\ell+p$ for
$0\leq\ell\leq q$. In other words, 
\[
((f\times g)\times h)(\sigma)=(-1)^{pq+qr+rp}
f(\sigma_1\circ\alpha_p)g(\sigma_2\circ\mu_q)h(\sigma_3\circ\omega_r)\,.
\]
I've used associativity of the ring. But you get exactly the same thing when
you expand $(f\times(g\times h))(\sigma)$, so the cross product is associative.
\end{proof}

Of course the diagonal map is ``associative,'' too, and we find that the
cup product is associative:
\[
(\alpha\cup\beta)\cup\gamma=\alpha\cup(\beta\cup\gamma)\,.
\]
