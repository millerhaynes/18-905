\section{Tensor and Tor}

We continue to study properties of the tensor product. Recall that 
\[
A\otimes \Z/n\Z=A/nA\,.
\]
Consider the exact sequence 
\[
0\to \Z\xrightarrow{2}\Z\to \Z/2\Z\to 0\,.
\]
Let's tensor it with $\Z/2\Z$. We get
\[
0\to \Z/2\Z\to\Z/2\Z\to\Z/2\Z\to 0\,.
\]
This cannot be a short exact sequence! 
This is a major tragedy: tensoring doesn't preserve exact sequences; one says that $\Z/n\Z\otimes-$ is not ``exact.'' This is why we can't form homology with coefficients in $A$ by simply tensoring homology with $A$. 

Tensoring does respect certain exact sequences:
\begin{prop}
The functor $N\mapsto M\otimes_R N$ preserves cokernels; it is \emph{right exact}. 
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $N\to N''$ is a surjection of $R$-modules, and $M$ is any $R$-module. Then 
\[
\xymatrix{
M\otimes_RN \ar[r] & M\otimes_RN'' \\
M\times N \ar[u] \ar@{->>}[r] & M\times N'' \ar[u]\,.
}\]
At least we know that $M\times-$ preserves surjections. But the image of 
$M\times N''$ generates $M\otimes_RN''$ as an $R$-module, so the image of
$M\times N$ generates it as well. This implies that 
$M\otimes_RN\to M\otimes_RN''$ is surjective.
\end{proof}

How about this failure of exactness? What can we do about that? Failure of exactness is bad, so let's try to repair it. A key observation is that if 
$M$ is {\em free}, then $M\otimes_R-$ is exact. If $M=R\langle S\rangle$, the
free $R$-module on a set $S$, then $M\otimes_RN=\oplus_SN$, since tensoring
distributes over direct sums. Then we remember:
\begin{lemma}
If $M'_i\to M_i\to M''_i$ is exact for all $i\in I$, then so is 
\[
\bigoplus M'_i\to\bigoplus M_i\to\bigoplus M''_i\,.
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} Clearly the composite is zero. Let 
$(x_i\in M_i,i\in I)\in\bigoplus M_i$ and suppose it maps to zero. 
That means that each $x_i$ maps to zero in $M''_i$ and hence is in the
image of some $x'_i\in M'_i$. Just make sure to take $x'_i=0$ if $x_i=0$. 
\end{proof}

To exploit this observation, let's ``resolve'' $M$ by free modules. This means:
find a surjection from a free $R$-module, $F_0\to M$. This amounts to specifying $R$-module generators. The kernel of $F_0\to M$ won't generally be free. 
Let's make sure that it is by assuming that $R$ is a PID, and write $F_1$ for
the kernel. The failure of $M\otimes-$ to be exact is measured, at least
partially, by the leftmost term (defined as a kernel) in the exact sequence
\[
0\to\Tor_1^R(M,N)\to F_1\otimes_RN\to F_0\otimes_RN\to M\otimes_RN\to0\,.
\]

The notation suggests that this Tor term is independent of the resolution. 
This is indeed the case, as we shall show presently. But before we do, let's 
compute some Tor groups. 

\begin{example} 
For any PID $R$, if $M=F$ is free over $R$ we can take $F_0=F$
and $F_1=0$, and discover that then $\Tor_1^R(F,N)=0$ for any $N$. 
\end{example}
\begin{example} 
Let $R=\Z$ and $M=\Z/n\Z$, and $N$ any abelian group. When $R=\Z$ it is often
omitted from the notation for Tor.
There is a nice free resolution staring at us:
$F_0=F_1=\Z$, and $F_1\to F_0$ given by multiplication by $n$. The sequence
looks like 
\[
0\to\Tor_1(\Z/n\Z,N)\to\Z\otimes N\xrightarrow{n\otimes1}\Z\otimes N\to
\Z/n\Z\otimes N\to 0\,,
\]
so
\[
\Z/n\Z\otimes N=N/nN\,,\quad\Tor_1(\Z/n\Z,N)=\ker(n|N)\,.
\]
The torsion in this case is the ``$n$-torsion'' in $N$. This accounts for
the name.
\end{example}

Functors like $\Tor_1$ can be usefully defined for any ring, and moving to that
general case makes their significance clearer and illuminates the reason why 
$\Tor_1$ is independent of choice of generators. 

So let $R$ be any ring and $M$ a module over it. By picking $R$-module
generators I can produce a surjection from a free $R$-module, $F_0\to M$.
Write $K_0$ for the kernel of this map. It is the module of relations among
the generators. We can no longer guarantee that it's free, but we can at 
least find a set of module generators for it, and construct a surjection
from a free $R$-module, $F_1\to K_0$. Continuing in this way, we get a 
diagram like this -- 
\begin{equation*}
\xymatrix{\cdots\ar[rr] & & F_2\ar[dr]\ar[rr]^d & & F_1\ar[dr]\ar[rr]^d & & F_0\ar[dr]\\
& K_2\ar[ur]\ar[dr] & & K_1\ar[ur]\ar[dr] & & K_0\ar[ur]\ar[dr] & & N\ar[dr]\\
0\ar[ur] & & 0\ar[ur] & & 0\ar[ur] & & 0\ar[ur] & & 0}
\end{equation*}
-- in which the upside-down V subdiagrams are short exact sequences
and $F_s$ is free for all $s$. Splicing these exact sequences gives you an 
exact sequence in the top row. This is a \emph{free resolution of $N$}.
The top row, $F_*$, is a chain complex. It maps to the very short chain
complex with $N$ in degree 0 and 0 elsewhere, and this chain map is a 
homology isomorphism (or ``quasi-isomorphism''). We have in effect replaced
$N$ with this chain complex of free modules. The module $N$ may be very
complicated, with generators, relations, relations between relations \ldots.
All this is laid out in front of us by the free resolution. Generators of $F_0$
map to generators for $N$, and generators for $F_1$ map to relations among
those generators.
