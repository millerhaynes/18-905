The case $n=0$ is trivial (remembering the definition of 
$\widetilde H$), so suppose $n>0$
The first job is to compare $\RR^n$ to a compact manifold.
Let $S^n$ denote the one-point compactification of $\RR^n$.
Let $D^n$ be a disk in $\RR^n$ containing $K$. Define the map along the
top of the diagram below by requiring commutativity. 
\[
\xymatrix{
H_q(S^n,S^n-K) \ar[r] & H_{q-1}(\RR^n,K) \\
H_q(D^n,D^n-K) \ar[u]_\cong \ar[r]^\partial & 
\widetilde H_{q-1}(D^n-K) \ar[u]_\cong 
}\]
The vertical maps are isomorphisms by excision, and the boundary map
is an isomorphism by the long exact sequence. 

On the other hand, relative Poincar\'e duality gives us an isomorphism
\[
\cHH^{n-q}(K)\xrightarrow{\cong}H_q(S^n,S^n-K)\,.
\]
\end{proof}
