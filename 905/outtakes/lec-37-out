Miller's office hours are tomorrow, from 1-3 in 2-478. The first half of this lecture was just explaining the remark above by using less technology.

On the website, there are notes on $\pi_1(X,\ast)$. I'm assuming people have seen this thing. Assume $X$ is path-connected, and let $\ast\in X$. There's another technical assumption: semi-locally simply connected (SLSC), which means that for every $b\in X$ and neighborhood $b\in U$, there exists a smaller neighborhood $b\in V\subseteq U$ such that $\pi_1(V,b)\to\pi_1(X,b)$ is trivial. This is a very very weak condition.
\begin{theorem}
Let $X$ be a path-connected, SLSC space with $\ast\in X$. Then there is an equivalence of categories between covering spaces over $X$ and sets with an action of $\pi_1(X,\ast)$. The way this functor goes is by sending $p:E\to X$ to $p^{-1}(\ast)$, which has an action of $\pi_1(X,\ast)$ in the obvious way by path-lifting.
\end{theorem}
\begin{example}[Stupidest possible case]
Suppose $\mathrm{id}:X\to X$ is sent to $\ast$ with the trivial action. This is the terminal covering space over $X$.
\end{example}
We've been interested in $\Gamma(E;X)$, which is the same thing as $\Map_X(X\to X,E\to X)\cong\Map_{\pi_1(X)}(\ast,E_\ast)=(E_\ast)^{\pi_1(B)}$, the fixed points of the action. We also thought about the case of $E$ being a local system of $R$-modules, and the same functor gives an equivalence between local systems of $R$-modules and $R[\pi_1(X)]$-modules, i.e., representations of $\pi_1(X)$.

Recall that $o_M$ is the orientation local system, but now \emph{over $\Z$}. Thus, over a general ring, $o_{M,R}=o_M\otimes R$. We were thinking about what happens with a closed path-connected SLSC subset $\ast\in A\subseteq M$ of an $n$-manifold $M$, and then considering $\Gamma(A,o_M\otimes R)$, which we now see to be $(o_M\otimes R)_{\ast}^{\pi_1(A,\ast)}$. How many options do we have here?

That is to say, this local system $o_M$ is the same thing as the free abelian group $H_n(M,M-\ast)$ with an action of $\pi_1(X,\ast)$. There aren't many options for this action. In other words, this is a homomorphism $\pi_1(M,\ast)\to \Aut(H_n(M,M-\ast))$. I haven't chosen a generator for $H_n(M,M-\ast)$, and there's only two automorphisms, i.e., we get a homomorphism $w_1:\pi_1(M,\ast)\to\Z/2\Z$. This homomorphism is called the ``first Stiefel-Whitney class''. 18.906 will describe all the Stiefel-Whitney classes. With $R$-coefficients, I get a map $\pi_1(M,\ast)\to \Aut(H_n(M,M-\ast;R))\cong R^\times$. This is a natural construction, so this homomorphism $\pi_1(M,\ast)\to R^\times$ factors through $\pi_1(M,\ast)\to\Z/2\Z$. This lets us get a good handle on what the sections are: $\Gamma(A;o_M\otimes R)=H_n(M,M-\ast;R)^{\pi_1(X,\ast)}$, but our analysis shows that:
\begin{align*}
\Gamma(A;o_M\otimes R) & =H_n(M,M-\ast;R)^{\pi_1(X,\ast)}\\
& =\begin{cases}
H_n(M,M-\ast;R)\cong R & \text{if }w_1=1\text{, well-defined up to sign; the orientable case}\\
\ker(R\xrightarrow{2}R) & \text{if }w_1\neq 1\text{, and this is a canonical identification}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
where we get the latter thing because then $a=-a$, i.e., $2a=0$. In particular, if $R=\Z/2\Z$, since $\Aut_{\Z/2\Z}(\Z/2\Z)=1$, you always have a unique orientation. If $R=\Z/p\Z,\Z,\QQ$, then $\ker(R\xrightarrow{2}R)=0$.

We had a general theorem:
\begin{theorem}
$H_n(M,M-A;R)\xrightarrow{j,\cong}\Gamma_c(A;o_M\otimes R)$ and $H_q(M,M-A;R)=0$ for $q>n$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{corollary}
If $M$ is connected and $A=M$, and if $M$ is not compact, then $H_n(M;R)=0$. If $M$ is compact, then the work we just did shows that $H_n(M;R)=\begin{cases}R & \text{oriented} \\ \ker(R\xrightarrow{2}R) & \text{nonorientable}\end{cases}$.
\end{corollary}
