\section*{Preface}
Over the 2016--2017 academic year, I ran the graduate algebraic topology 
sequence at MIT. The first semester deals with singular homology and 
cohomology, and Poicar\'e duality; the second builds up basic homotopy theory,
spectral sequences, and characteristic classes. 

My goal was to give a standard classical approach to these subjects. 
In the first semester, I had various objectives. I wanted to introduce 
students to basic category theoretic language, so useful throughout
mathematics and finding is first real manifestations in algebraic 
topology. I wanted to stress the methods of homological algebra,
for similar reasons. And I especially wanted 
to give an honest account of the machinery -- relative cap product and
\v{C}ech cohomology --  needed in the proof of Poincar\'e duality. 

On the other hand I took some shortcuts. I gave only a brief summary of
the theory of covering spaces and the fundamental group -- in preparation
for a proper understanding of orientations. I avoided some point set
topology by working with only compact subspaces in the development of
Poincar\'e duality, rather than general closed subspaces. 

I was lucky enough to have in the audience a student, Sanath Devalapurkar, 
who spontaneously decided to {live\TeX} the entire course. This resulted in 
a remarkably accurate record of what happened in the classroom -- right down
to random alarms ringing and embarassing mistakes on the blackboard. 
Sanath's \TeX forms the basis of these notes, and I am grateful to him 
for making them available. The attractive line drawings were provided by
another student, Xianglong Ni. 

In the course of editing these notes, beyond correcting various errors 
(while hopefully not introducting new ones), I completed various arguments
not done in detail in the actual lectures, and rearranged some of the
material to take full advantage of hindsight. But no matter how much
revision occured in this process, I want to stress that there is no way
this manuscript could come into existence without Sanath's original script. 


\newpage
%Here are hyperlinks to the notes from each of the semesters.

%        \item The notes for 18.905 start at section \ref{905}.
%        \item The notes for 18.906 start at section \ref{906}.

%\section*{Stuff to fix}
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item The original version of the notes used
%	\verb|\cc| to denote both a script C and the complex numbers.
%	Now, \verb|\cc| denotes a script C and \verb|\cC| denotes the complex
%	numbers.
%	Everytime you find this, edit it!
%    \item Be consistent about your use of $\Hom_\cc(C,D)$ and $\cc(C,D)$ for hom-sets.
%\end{itemize}



%\section*{Things to fix}
%\begin{itemize}
%    \item As of \today, all of Part II has been edited, with the exception of
%	\S \ref{basepoints}, \S \ref{section-serre-classes}, \S
%	\ref{mod-c-hurewicz}, \S \ref{dress-sseq}, \S \ref{leray-hirsch}, and
%	\S \ref{gysin-sequence}.
%    \item Part I remains to be edited.
%    \item The original version of the notes used \verb|\cc| to denote both a
%	script C and the complex numbers.  Now, \verb|\cc| denotes a script C
%	and \verb|\cC| denotes the complex numbers. This is a problem that
%	needs to be fixed everywhere.
