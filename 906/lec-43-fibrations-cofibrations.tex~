\section{Fibrations and cofibrations}
\subsection{Comparing fibers over different points}
Let $p:E\to B$ be a fibration.
Above, we saw that this implies that paths in $B$ ``lift'' to paths in $E$.
Let us consider a path $\omega:I\to B$ with $\omega(0) = a$ and $\omega(1) = b$.
Denote by $F_a$ the fiber over $a$. If $p$ is a covering space, then 
unique path lifting provides us with a homeomorphism $F_a\to F_b$ depending
only on the homotopy class of the path $\omega$. Our first goal today is
to construct an analogous map for a general fibration. 

Consider the solid arrow diagram:
\begin{equation*}
    \xymatrix{
	F_a\ar[d]_{\mathrm{in}_0}\ar[rr] & & E\ar[d]^p\\
	I\times F_a\ar@{-->}[urr]^{h}\ar[r]_{\mathrm{pr}_1} & I\ar[r]_{\omega} & B.
    }
\end{equation*}
This commutes since $\omega(0) = a$.
Utilizing the homotopy lifting property, there is a dotted arrow that makes the entire diagram commute.
If $x\in F_a$, the image $h(1,x)$ is in $F_b$.
This supplies us with a map $f:F_a\to F_b$, given by $f(x) = h(1,x)$.

Since we are not working with a covering space, there will in general be
many lifts $h$ and so many choices of $f$. We may at least hope that the 
homotopy class of $f$ is determined by the homotopy class of $\omega$. 

So suppose we have two paths $\omega_0,\omega_1$ with $\omega_0(0) = \omega_1(0) = a$, and a homotopy $g:I\times I\to B$ between them (so that $g(0,t)=\omega_0(t)$ and $g(1,t)=\omega_1(t)$). Choose lifts $h_0$ and $h_1$ as above. 
These data are captured by a diagram of the form
\begin{equation*}
    \xymatrix{
	((\partial I\times I)\cup (I\times \{0\}))\times F_a\ar[d]_{\mathrm{in}_0}\ar[rr] & & E\ar[d]^p\\
	I\times I\times F_a\ar[r]_{\mathrm{pr}_1}\ar@{-->}[urr] & I\times I\ar[r]_g & B
    }
\end{equation*}
The map along the top is given by $h_0$ and $h_1$ on 
$\partial I\times I\times F_a$ and by $pr_2:I\times F_a\to F_a$ followed by
the inclusion on the other summand. 

The dotted lift would restrict on $I\times\{1\}$ to a homotopy between 
$f_0$ and $f_1$. 

% Add a picture, maybe?
%
%Think of the space $(\partial I\times I)\cup (I\times 0)$ as follows:
%\begin{equation*}
%\begin{tikzpicture}
%    \draw (2,2) -- (0,2) -- (0,0) -- (2,0);
%    \node [above] at (1,2) {$h_1$};
%    \node [below] at (1,0) {$h_0$};
%    \node [left] at (0,1) {$in_0$};
%\end{tikzpicture}
%\end{equation*}
%and $I\times I$ looks like:
%\begin{equation*}
%    \begin{tikzpicture}
%	\draw (0,0) -- (0,2) -- (2,2) -- (2,0) -- (0,0);
%	\draw[fill] (2,2) circle [radius=0.05];
%	\draw[fill] (2,0) circle [radius=0.05];
%	\node [left] at (0,1) {$a$};
%	\node [above] at (1,2) {$\omega_1$};
%	\node [below] at (1,0) {$\omega_0$};
%	\node [right] at (2,1) {$b$};
%	\node [above right] at (2,2) {$f_1$};
%	\node [below right] at (2,0) {$f_0$};
%    \end{tikzpicture}
%\end{equation*}
%
%Does the dotted map exist? Clearly this is crying out for us to use the homotopy lifting property. But what should our space $W$ be? Well the following pair:
%\begin{equation*}
%    \begin{tikzpicture}
%	\draw (2,2) -- (0,2) -- (0,0) -- (2,0);
%    \end{tikzpicture}\subseteq
%    \begin{tikzpicture}
%	\draw (0,0) -- (0,2) -- (2,2) -- (2,0) -- (0,0);
%    \end{tikzpicture}
%\end{equation*}
%is homotopy equivalent to $(0\subseteq I)\times I$. Hence in our diagram we now have:

Well, the subspace $(\partial I\times I)\cup(I\times\{0\}$ of $I\times I$
wraps around three edges of the square. It's easy enough to create a 
homeomorphism with the pair $(I\times I,\{0\}\times I)$, so the HLP (with 
$W=I\times F_a$) gives us the dotted lift.

We will capture this fact in a statement about the action of paths. Recall that
the fundamental group of a pointed space $(X,*)$ acts on the fiber $F_*$
of any covering space of $X$. We have just shown that it also acts on the
homotopy type of the fiber of any fibration over $X$. It's useful to express
this in a way that does not specify a basepoint (and hence is meaningful
even for non path connected spaces). 
Recall that a {\em groupoid} is a small category in which every morphism
is an isomorphism.
\begin{definition}
    Let $X$ be a topological space.
    The \emph{fundamental groupoid} $\Pi_1(X)$ of $X$ is the groupoid
    whose objects are the points of $X$ and whose morphisms are the 
homotopy classes of paths in $X$.
    The composition of compatible paths $\sigma$ and $\omega$ is defined by:
    \begin{equation*}
	(\sigma\cdot\omega)(t) = \begin{cases}
	    \omega(2t) & 0\leq t\leq 1/2\\
	    \sigma(2t - 1) & 1/2\leq t\leq 1.
	\end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
The results of the previous sections can be succinctly summarized as follows.
\begin{prop}
    A fibration $p:E\to B$ determines a functor $\Pi_1(B)\to\Ho\Top$.
\end{prop}
Note: Last semester we defined the product of loops as juxtaposition but in
the reverse order. This convention would have produced a contravariant functor
$\Pi_1(X)\to\Ho\Top$.

\subsection{Cofibrations}
Let $i:A\to X$ be a map of spaces.
If $Y$ is another topological space, when is the induced map $Y^X\to Y^A$ a fibration?
This is asking for the map $i$ to be ``dual'' to a fibration.

By the definition of a fibration, we want a lifting:
\begin{equation*}
    \xymatrix{
	W\ar[r]\ar[d]_{\mathrm{in}_0} & Y^X\ar[d]\\
	I\times W\ar@{-->}[ur]\ar[r] & Y^A.
    }
\end{equation*}
Adjointing over, we get:
\begin{equation*}
    \xymatrix{
	A\times W\ar[r]^{i\times 1}\ar[d]_{1\times \mathrm{in}_0} & X\times W\ar[d]\ar[ddr]& \\
	A\times W\times I \ar[r]\ar[drr] & X\times I\times W\ar@{-->}[dr] & \\
	& & Y.
    }
\end{equation*}
Again adjointing over, this diagram transforms to:
\begin{equation*}
    \xymatrix{
	A\ar[r]\ar[d] & X\ar[d]\ar[ddr] & \\
	A\times I\ar[r]\ar[drr] & X\times I\ar@{-->}[dr] & \\
	& & Y^W.
    }
\end{equation*}
This discussion motivates the following definition of a ``cofibration,''
dual to the notion of fibration.

\begin{definition}\label{cofibration}
A {\em cofibration} is a map $i:A\to X$ that satisfies 
    \emph{homotopy extension property} (sometimes abbreviated as ``HEP''):
    for any space $Y$, there is a dotted map in the following diagram that makes it commute:
    \begin{equation*}
    \xymatrix{
	A\ar[r]\ar[d] & X\ar[d]\ar[ddr] & \\
	A\times I\ar[r]\ar[drr] & X\times I\ar@{-->}[dr] & \\
	& & Y\,.
    }
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
By the universal property of a pushout, this is equivalent to the existence
of an extension in 
\begin{equation*}
    \xymatrix{
	X\cup_A (A\times I)\ar[r]\ar[dr] & X\times I\ar@{-->}[d]\\
	& Y\,.
    }
\end{equation*}
Now there is a univeral example, namely $Y=X\cup_A(A\times I)$. So a map
$i$ is a cofibration if and only if $X\cup_A (A\times I)$ is a retract of 
$X\times I$.

\begin{example}\label{intervalcofib}
    $S^{n-1}\hookrightarrow D^n$ is a cofibration.
    \todo{Properly draw out this figure!}
    \begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{retract-cofibration}
	\caption{Drawing by John Ni.}
    \end{figure}
    In particular, setting $n=1$ in this example, $\{0,1\}\hookrightarrow I$ is a cofibration.
\end{example}

The class of cofibrations is closed under the following operations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cobase change: if $A\to X$ is a cofibration and $A\to B$ is any map,
	the pushout $B\to X\cup_A B$ is also cofibration.
    \item Coproducts.
    \item Composition.
\end{itemize}
Also, it satisfies the condition that we used to motivate the definition:
If $A\to X$ is a cofibration and $Y$ is an space, then $Y^X\to Y^A$ is a 
fibration. In particular, the map 
\[
Y^I\to Y\times Y
\]
given by evaluation at the endpoints of the path is a fibration.

Finally, 
\begin{lemma} 
Any cofibration is a closed inclusion.
\end{lemma}

\begin{example}
An important, but easy, fact about fibrations is that the canonical map 
$X\to \ast$ from any space $X$ is a fibration.
(Afficianados of model categories get excited about this 
because this says that all objects in the associated model structure on
topological spaces is fibrant.)
After all, the dotted lift in the diagram below can be taken to the map $(t,w)\mapsto f(w)$:
\begin{equation*}
    \xymatrix{
    W\ar[d]\ar[r]^f & X\ar[d]\\
    I\times W\ar@{-->}[ur]\ar[r] & \ast.
}
\end{equation*}
\end{example}

\begin{exercise}
The ``dual'' statement is false.    
Give an example of a compactly generated space $X$ containing a point
$*$ such that $\{*\}\hookrightarrow X$ is not a cofibration.
\end{exercise}
A bsepoint $*$ is {\em nondegenerate} if $\{*\}\hookrightarrow X$ 
is a cofibration. 
If $\ast$ has a neighborhood in $X$ that contracts to $\ast$,
the inclusion $\ast\hookrightarrow X$ is a cofibration.
If $\ast$ is a nondegenerate basepoint of $A$, the evaluation map 
$\mathrm{ev}:X^A\to X$ is a fibration,
The fiber of $\mathrm{ev}$ over a basepoint of $X$ 
is exactly the space of pointed maps $A\to X$.
